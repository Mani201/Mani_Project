Development environment : Keil 5

Target Board : Nucleo-f429zi

used module : LED , Ultrasonic sensors

Measure the distance with an ultrasonic sensor and activate the LED at a certain distance. 

(5cm ~ 10cm LED1 On, 10cm ~ 15cm LED2 On ... )

When a command is sent from a PC to the target board, the measured distance value is repeated and sent to the PC.
